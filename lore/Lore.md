**The Oath of Stone and Flame: The Tale of Brenden & Zach**

  

There were once two names whispered in the lowlight taverns of Skyreach and etched into the frost-slick canyon stones of the Dweorven North. Not whispered out of fear—but in reverence. Brenden, the Ironborn of Grotskarr, and Zach, the Wandering Sigilist of the Fifth School.

  

Brenden was shaped in the stone-cradle of the Dwarrowholds, where newborns were baptized in molten iron and lullabied with the rhythm of forgehammers. His armor, Duresteel-forged and rune-etched, bore scars not from battle—but from prophecy. His axe, _Durnskald_, was a relic older than his bloodline, humming with the deep harmonics of stone-magic, the kind that could cleave through both basalt and lies.

  

Zach, by contrast, was born beneath a red moon and raised among scrolls in the floating sanctum of Kelmith’ar. He wielded no blade, but the staff he carried—whittled from worldroot wood and bound with the silver veins of sky-iron—was alive with ancient consciousness. His spells were not incantations shouted, but names remembered. Each syllable he spoke peeled back the veil of reality, revealing the threads beneath: light, time, thought.

  

They met not by chance but by Threadbond, a concept Zach would later explain over a midnight fire. “The Pattern knows,” he said, eyes reflecting firelight and stars alike, “when two souls must weave together.”

  

Together they crossed the Hollow Deserts, where Brenden fought sandwraiths with his feet planted like bedrock, while Zach summoned mirrors of wind to carve escape routes. They stormed the Skyvault Citadel, where Brenden shattered the obsidian gates and Zach inverted gravity itself to bring down the warlocks within.

  

But it was at the Shivering Pass, when the gods fell silent and the Veil began to rot, that their bond was tested. Brenden, ever grounded, bore the weight of corrupted spirits clawing at the edge of the world. Zach, unraveling at the seams from overcasting, held the spell—the _Evershield of Kel_—for seven heartbeats longer than any other Sigilist had dared.

  

And when the sky cracked open and the gods returned, it was said they found two figures standing firm against the storm: one rooted in stone, the other alight with forgotten fire.

  

To this day, the Oath of Stone and Flame is whispered in moments of desperation. Not as a prayer to gods—but in memory of the two who held the line when even the heavens turned away.
