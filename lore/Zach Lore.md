Hi, I am looking for a roommate in Chicago starting mid July to early August . I am about to be 24, and a 2023 grad from University of Michigan. My budget is between 1400-1600, and Iâ€™m interested in living in lakeview/ Lincoln park / old town.

I currently work remotely as a data analyst, so I would like a place that has a lot of space and natural light. I definitely prefer older building with some style, and preferably with a deck / good spot to hang outside. 

My interests include the outdoors, music, and water sports. I enjoy thrifting & reworking clothing and furniture, as well as cooking.

Would definitely like to be friends with my roommate, so reach out if you think we would get along!

Questions about room:
is there anywhere to keep my bike?
is there additional storage overall?
