### **Backstory:**

  

Darius Kade grew up in a upper-tier citizen block of the Chicago Arcology — a sprawling vertical megastructure in Earth Prime’s North American region. A gifted strategist and history obsessive, Darius spent his teenage years immersed in war sims and virtual reenactments of ancient empires. His fascination with Rome — especially its eastern remnant, Byzantium — became a lifelong obsession.

  

After working for nearly a decade in defense analytics and gambling on political crypto exchanges, Darius finally amassed enough credits to purchase a **Class III Independent Rift License**. This license granted him ownership of a small stable dimensional node — one tagged as **“Echo-79: Byzantium-Consistent, ~780 AD”**. The world mirrors early Byzantine history with only minor divergences — ideal for his plan.

### **Equipment:**

- **Subdermal HUD Implant** – Language processing, combat simulation overlays, and facial recognition.
    
- **Synthetic Fiber Cloak** – Appears like rough Byzantine wool, but resists blades and regulates temperature.
    
- **OS Companion “VICTRIX”** – A tactical AI modeled after Roman military doctrines; voice can toggle between a cold strategist or a charismatic advisor.
    
- **Nano-Med Injector** – Heals wounds, filters toxins, and boosts stamina.
    
- **Foldable Drone Scout** – A palm-sized device that expands into a flying observer capable of relaying battlefield maps and projecting divine imagery.

### **Personality:**

  

Darius is driven, idealistic, and dangerously confident. He believes that if given the chance, he could build a better empire — one that avoids Rome’s mistakes. But beneath his ambition is a lonely, idealistic young man who’s unsure whether he’s chasing glory… or simply trying to matter.


He has little patience for bureaucracy or corporate restraint, which is why he chose to go solo. He sees his move not as colonization, but as “historical optimization” — he believes he can guide the Byzantines to a stronger, smarter future.

### **Motivation:**

  

Darius doesn’t just want power — he wants **legacy**. In his world, he’s one of billions. But in Echo-79, he could be Caesar, Augustus, Justinian reborn.
