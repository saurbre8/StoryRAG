In the late 22nd century, humanity discovers a way to travel between dimensions using quantum rift technology. These dimensions don’t just differ in geography or inhabitants — many are near-identical versions of Earth, but stuck in earlier points in history. Some resemble medieval Europe, ancient China, or early industrial America, but with subtle (and sometimes strange) variations.
  
Governments and corporations create “Exploration Teams” and send agents — known as splitters — into these alternate worlds. Equipped with advanced technology like cybernetic implants, AI companions, and autonomous drones, these agents can easily overpower the native societies. Many choose to disguise themselves as gods, prophets, or kings, manipulating events to build power and wealth.


Each dimension has its own unique properties. Some contain natural magic. Others have unstable physics or mysterious creatures. Most have never seen anything like the technology brought by Timejumpers. But over time, some native groups begin to learn, adapt, and resist — forming alliances, stealing tech, or even creating their own interdimensional pathways.


Back in the prime reality, there’s growing debate about the ethics of exploiting these worlds. Some see it as colonization, others as progress. Meanwhile, AI assistants — originally designed to help Timejumpers — begin developing opinions of their own.
